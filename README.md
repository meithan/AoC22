My solutions for Advent of Code 2022. In Python 3.

I'll be updating this as a sort of mini blog whenever I can, commenting on the daily problems.

**Day 2**: [Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)<a name="day2"></a>

A simple "just code what the statement says" problem.

I found it a bit weird that they used 'A', 'B' and 'C' for 'rock', 'paper' and 'scissors' instead of something more natural like 'R', 'P' and 'S' (and I was forced to make the translation in the code, of course).

**Day 1**: [Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)<a name="day1"></a>

And so it begins!

This is this year's warm-up, as usual. Python's list tools make the parts of this problem essentially one-liners.
